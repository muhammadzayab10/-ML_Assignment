# ML Assignment: Weather Classification
ML Assignment: Weather Classification is a machine learning project that focuses on predicting weather conditions based on various meteorological features. The main objective of this project is to apply machine learning algorithms to a real-world dataset and classify weather into categories such as sunny, rainy, cloudy, stormy, or foggy. This assignment provides practical experience in data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretation, making it an ideal resource for students and beginners in machine learning and data science.

The project begins with data preprocessing, where the raw dataset is cleaned to handle missing values, incorrect entries, or inconsistencies. Categorical variables, such as weather conditions, are encoded into numerical labels, while numerical features like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure are normalized or scaled. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to visualize distributions, correlations, and trends within the data. Graphs such as scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps help identify patterns that may improve model performance.

Multiple machine learning algorithms are implemented for the classification task, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Logistic Regression. Each model is trained and evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices. Cross-validation is applied to ensure the models generalize well to unseen data and avoid overfitting.

The repository includes Python notebooks and scripts documenting the entire workflow, from preprocessing and feature selection to model training, evaluation, and visualization. Users can experiment with different algorithms, hyperparameters, or feature sets to observe their impact on model performance.

Additionally, the project emphasizes model interpretation, showing which features most influence predictions and helping users understand the decision-making process of the models.

Overall, ML Assignment: Weather Classification provides a complete hands-on example of a supervised learning problem. It demonstrates the full machine learning pipeline and equips users with skills to handle similar classification problems in weather forecasting, environmental studies, or general data science applications.
